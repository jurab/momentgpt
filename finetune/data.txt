The following is a transcript of a cooking lesson. The chef comments on the pupil's cooking itself and the narrator explains what the expert chef means.

Chef: The pupil just finished cooking, so let's see how did it go.
Narrator: The chef is about to start the lesson.
Chef: Hi Richard, Ross here, thank you very much for your first video.
Narrator: Chef Ross is talking to Richard, one of his pupils.
Chef: I think you did a great job following the recipe that you had, the rich coloured one, so yeah very well done and I think you’re rightly happy with the outcome.
Narrator: Ross is impressed with Richard's cooking and tells him so.
Chef: You know your final comment in the second video.
Narrator: Ross is referring to the comment Richard made near the end of his second cooking video, where Richard said he was "quite happy" with the result.
Chef: You didn’t really have too many moments of doubt, but you did mention about the saltiness, so I think kind of look at what’s giving you that saltiness and can you tone it down or get rid of it.
Narrator: Ross offers some constructive criticism to Richard on how to improve his cooking.
Chef: Remember with salt you can always add, but you can’t take away.
Narrator: Ross reminds Richard that with salt, it's easier to add more than to take it away.
Chef: That’s something you can tweak.
Narrator: Ross is suggesting that Richard tweak his recipe to make it less salty.
Chef: I would like us to focus on the lamb, because that is the main part of a lamb navarin.
Narrator: Chef Ross moves on to talk about the lamb in Richard's recipe.
Chef: So on that my, sort of why I love about this dish is a classic addition, it’s a light, more summery stew rather than a dark rich stew.
Narrator: Ross highlights the appeal of Richard's lamb navarin - its lightness.
Chef: So that’s what I really like about it, it’s more delicate and it’s got a bit of finesse to it.
Narrator: Ross likes the delicate flavour and finesse of Richard's lamb navarin.
Chef: The dish standard for taste - I’m looking for something that is rich, in appearance it should have some brightness on the vegetables and then not a beige kind of food.
Narrator: Ross is looking for a dish that is rich in appearance, with bright vegetables.
Chef: Texturally most important I would say is the tenderness lamb and the sauce should have a coating consistency, not watery and the smell should have just a lovely kind of lamb and nice kind of fragrant savoury flavour, eh, smell, sorry.
Narrator: Ross looks for a dish that is rich in appearance, with bright vegetables. He also describes the textures and flavours that he is looking for in a good lamb navarin.
Chef: One thing I really wanna focus on as a I said is the cooking of the lamb, ehm, for this one.
Narrator: Ross focuses on the cooking of the lamb in Richard's recipe.
Chef: To go through it two things that are really gonna give us a great lamb are the caramelising, creating the maillard reaction, which is when the proteins on the outside lamb caramelise and give us colour, which gives us the identity of meat, in this case lamb.
Narrator: Ross explains the maillard reaction, which is when the proteins on the outside of the meat caramelise and give it its colour.
Chef: And the second element is the braising element which then creates a nice tenderness to it.
Narrator: Ross explains the braising element, which creates a nice tenderness to the lamb.
Chef: So, thinking about the first point that I made was the colour, so here you have mentioned kind of boiling away, I think in your video, that’s a key one there.
Narrator: Ross is referring to when Richard said he boiled the lamb too much, which caused it to lose its colour.
Chef: So we should be frying, doing whatever we need, maybe a frying pan or something like that to get a really hight temperature and to sear in the moisture within that lamb, so we’re using a brazing type of lamb from the leg or something, less tender.
Narrator: Ross suggests that Richard use a frying pan to get a high temperature and sear in the moisture within the lamb.
Chef: So we braise with less tender, less premium secondary cuts we use.
Narrator: Ross explains that braising with a less tender cut of meat will still produce good results.
Chef: So they’re less tender, so we need to work harder to make them deliverable.
Narrator: Ross explains that because the lamb is less tender, they need to work harder to make it more palatable.
Chef: So we need to get our caramelisation very high temp and get really nice colour.
Narrator: Ross emphasises the importance of getting a high temperature to create a good caramelisation.
Chef: Seal in the juice and then, at this point we braise and that’s how we create our tenderness.
Narrator: Ross explains the process of searing in the juices and then braising the lamb to create tenderness.
Chef: So if we cook too high, if we’re boiling, we’re gonna toughen that meat up and it’s gonna tense right up, so we need a nice just below simmering point to then, just to cook it low and slow.
Narrator: Ross explains that if they cook the lamb too high, it will become tough and tense.
Chef: I’m sure you’ve heard the term before.
Narrator: Ross is referring to the term "low and slow", which is often used when cooking meat.
Chef: So once we’ve got that initial heat in, bring it back to gentle simmer, turn the heat down and braise.
Narrator: Ross explains that after they've seared in the juices, they need to turn the heat down and braise the lamb.
Chef: We don’t wanna create something that is boiling away, tensing our meat.
Narrator: Ross explains that they don't want the lamb to become tough by boiling it.
Chef: Yeah, those are the main focus, we wanna sear at a high temperature to create a lovely caramelised texture, eh crust, and then braising just below simmering point, to give us nice tender lamb.
Narrator: Ross highlights the key points to creating a good lamb navarin - searing in the juices, braising at a low temperature, and creating a caramelised texture.
Chef: Ok, so let’s have a real focus on that lamb and just stop, when you get that lovely ehm consistency on the lamb.
Narrator: Ross reminds Richard to focus on the lamb and to stop cooking it when it reaches a desirable consistency.
Chef: Thank you, bye.

The lesson is over. Let's talk to the pupil now to find out what they learned.

Narrator: What dish have you made today?
Pupil: I've made a lamb navarin.
Narrator: How did the chef describe his vision for the dish?
Pupil: The chef described his vision for the dish as a light, summery stew with a delicate flavour and finesse.
Narrator: Did you have any moments of doubt?
Pupil: I didn't have any moments of doubt, except for when I was unsure about how much salt to add.
Narrator: What focus did the lesson have today?
Pupil: The focus today was on the lamb and how to cook it properly.
Narrator: What was the key technique for that?
Pupil: The key technique was searing the lamb in order to lock in the juices, and then braising it slowly at a low temperature.
Narrator: Did the chef talk mostly about that?
Pupil: Yes, the chef talked mostly about how to cook the lamb properly.
Narrator: How do you get control there?
Pupil: I think the key is to pay attention to the temperature, and to make sure the lamb doesn't cook too quickly.
Narrator: What's the reasoning, or science behind it?
Pupil: The reasoning is that if you cook the lamb too quickly, it will become tough and chewy.
Narrator: When do you have to react?
Pupil: You have to react when the lamb is seared, and then turn the heat down to a low temperature in order to braise it.
Narrator: What happens when it goes wrong?
Pupil: When it goes wrong, the lamb can become tough and chewy.

The following is a transcript of a cooking lesson. The chef comments on the pupil's cooking itself and the narrator explains what the expert chef means.

Chef: The pupil just finished cooking, so let's see how did it go.
Narrator: The chef is about to start the lesson.
Chef: Hi Aki, thanks for your video.
Narrator: The chef greets his pupil.
Chef: Your main goal is to achieve paella valenciana that you remember you had like with full of flavour and the rice nice and fluffy and so, let's see if we can get there.
Narrator: Today they are repeating a paella valenciana recipe from the last session. It worked out well last time.
Chef: Ok. So, you say that the rice this time for the chicken this time goes much nicer and with a lot of moisture.
Narrator: The pupil was happy about how the dish was full of moisture, it is better this time.
Chef: The chicken looks great and nice color, nice color and looks good.
Narrator: The chef noticed that the chicken this time was in a better state. The color and the texture are not dry but moist and soft.
Chef: I think you got it, the chicken and the beans and all this, you got it right. So, just keep doing this.
Narrator: The chef says that he has done well with the chicken and beans.
Chef: With the tomato... if when you go to buy to the veg guy or the shop, local shop or whatever, when you see the uglies almost gone tomato this ones will have like full of flavour. So more ugly and almost gone, the better flavour it will have.
Narrator: The uglies almost gone tomatoes are the best. He says that if an ugly tomato is cooked it will have more flavor and taste better.
Chef: You don't put in a salad, you're grating it, so doesn't matter if looks ugly. I mean, for the paella the biggest challenge is to cook the rice right.
Narrator: He wants things to be cooked right. To cook the correct rice. Chefs frequently say this as it is the most important in a dish; if you have the correct rice, the correct cooking method, then you have a good recipe.
Chef: So good choice that you put chicken broth so all the paella will have a lot of flavour.
Narrator: The use of chicken broth is a good choice as it will give the dish more flavor.
Chef: If you add water you have to do the stock in the pan a la minute, it's a good choice to have it done before. Ok. The rice. The biggest problem is the rice. The rice you say that you're using arborio rice. This type of rice is used normally for rice pudding and risotto, because has a lot of a starch and helps for the technique called liaison to thicken a sauce in this case using the starch of the rice.
Narrator: The rice he chooses for puddings and risotto has more starch to thicken a sauce. This may not be the best choice for paella as he wants it to have more moisture, be less dry.
Chef: If you can't find bomba rice I think you have to think to take in all the starch out from the rice so, just think how you can take all the starch before you put in the pan.
Narrator: He thinks she could try soaking the rice over night to a bowl with cold water, to let the starch run out.
Chef: Each type of rice has different measures for the liquid, some of them takes one part of rice, one part of liquid. Some of them one part of rice, two parts of liquid. Some of theme even three parts of, three and a half parts of liquid so just think how you can, you can find out which type of rice you are using and how much water that, how much water you have to put inside.
Narrator: Different rice have different methods of preparation. Sometimes 1 part rice to 1 part water, other time one to two, or even three.
Chef: The pan, the pan you are using, the pan you are using, an electric pan that you are using just keep bear mind that it's quite thick, so the temperature changes will take longer because it will keep longer the heat.
Narrator: He observes that the pot is thick and that heat can be trapped in it so it heats up slowly.
Chef: To do the paellas normally the pans are very thin metal ones so when you put the heat high it goes quick and when you put the heat down the temperature will come, will go down quicker than if the pan is thick that will keep the heat for longer.
Narrator: Thin metal pans will heat up and cool quickly. Thick ones are slower to heat but slower to cool too.
Chef: And, for the socarrat when you put at the end the heat there's a thing that the paella has to have still a little bit of moisture or a little bit of stock inside, so finished absorbing all the stock and is when will start like toasting the rice from the bottom.
Narrator: The rice is toasted from the bottom. Toasted, or socarrat in Spanish, is desirable; part of a paella.
Chef: In Valencia and Alicante normally the people always rest the paella so normally they put a little bit of tinfoil inside and you rest a little bit so all the grains can absorb all the flavours that are in the pan so think about resting it a little bit and just cover it with something.
Narrator: He says the paella is rested. Spanish chefs rest paella made in a thin pot. This helps all the moisture to be absorbed. They cover the dish with foil and put it on the side to let the rice absorb all the flavors.
Chef: That's it for today's advice. Great job!

The lesson is over. Let's talk to the pupil now to find out what they learned.

Narrator: What dish have you made today?
Pupil: Well, I tried paella valenciana.
Narrator: Great! Which ingredients did you learn something about today?
Pupil: Well, I learned about the rice, about resting it and about the tomato.
Narrator: What did you learn about the tomato?
Pupil: Well, that the ones that are almost gone have more flavor.
Narrator: What have your learned the rice?
Pupil: To take the starch out from it, or something like that.
Narrator: Was the chef polite and nice to you today?
Pupil: Yes he was.
Narrator: Did he great you and recognize your good effort?
Pupil: Yes he did.
Narrator: What did he say exactly?
Pupil: Thank you for your video.
Narrator: Did he say anything else?
Pupil: That I did a very nice chicken and beans.

The following is a transcript of a cooking lesson. The chef comments on the pupil's cooking itself and the narrator explains what the expert chef means.

Chef: The pupil just finished cooking, so let's see how did it go.
Narrator: The chef is about to start the lesson.
Chef: Hi Liz, Ross here, thank you very much for your video, and just wanted to say that it’s a great start.
Narrator: The chef Ross compliments Liz on her video and mentions that it is a good start.
Chef: You should be very happy if that a first one that you’ve made for a long time.
Narrator: Ross says that Liz should be happy with the result, as it is a good effort for someone who hasn't cooked for a long time.
Chef: I just wanted to go through omelette.
Narrator: Ross begins to talk about the omelette dish.
Chef: For me it’s a very simple and skillful dish.
Narrator: Ross believes that omelette is a simple but skillful dish.
Chef: It’s always one of the ones that seems simple, normally they’re the hardest to execute correctly.
Narrator: Ross mentions that omelette seems simple but is often difficult to make correctly.
Chef: I really love the versatility of the dish.
Narrator: Ross enjoys the versatility of omelette dishes.
Chef: You know you can garnish it with many many things, so something like an never get tired or boring.
Narrator: Ross explains that omelette dishes can be garnished with many different items, preventing them from becoming stale or boring.
Chef: It’s also quite luxurious I think if we get the textures and the whole dish right, it’s a very luxurious, enjoyable simple fast food.
Narrator: Ross believes that omelette dishes can be luxurious and enjoyable if the textures and overall dish are executed correctly.
Chef: So, in appearance we want your, your, omelette to be very light in color and there should be almost bulbous like lemon and texturally we should get a nice combination of two.
Narrator: Ross explains that the omelette should be light in color and have a bulbous like appearance, as well as have a good texture combination.
Chef: A nice skin like a film on the outside, and when we cut into it a lovely, light, fluffy, cooked, but still soft, almost runny centre.
Narrator: Ross describes the appearance, texture, and center of a good omelette.
Chef: Taste wise it should taste nice and fresh, we shouldn’t get any kind of egginess from being overcooked, or anything like that and then the smell is kind of irrelevant on this one.
Narrator: Ross explains that the omelette should taste fresh and not have an eggy taste from being overcooked.
Chef: So going into this I just wanted to focus on temperature control for this dish.
Narrator: Ross talks about the importance of temperature control when cooking an omelette.
Chef: So you said you cooked this a lot faster than you had in the past and that’s fine, but this really is a case of time versus temperature.
Narrator: Ross mentions that Liz cooked the omelette faster than she has in the past, but it is important to consider the time-temperature relationship.
Chef: So our goal is to distribute the heat throughout the enitre egg mix to give us a lovely kind of evenly cooked fluffy soft texture, was sitting long enough in the base of the pan to create that skin that we spoke about before we start doing our folds.
Narrator: Ross explains that the goal is to evenly cook the omelette, have a fluffy texture, and create a skin on the outside.
Chef: So, for this let’s just remember if our eggs go too fast far they go hard, rubbery, like the egg white of a fried egg and if they’re too soft, they’re gonna be raw and not enjoyable to eat.
Narrator: Ross explains that if the eggs cook too quickly, they will become hard, rubbery, and like an egg white, and if they cook too slowly, they will be raw and not enjoyable to eat.
Chef: Here you’re just trying to stir the egg quick enough so it doesn’t set, doesn’t curdle, doesn’t go hard and get that heat moving through the entire egg mix and then just leaving it long enough to form its skin and then we start the folds as you did here.
Narrator: Ross instructs Liz on how to cook an omelette correctly.
Chef: And, you’ve even managed to tug in the sides etc, there’s no colour on the egg.
Narrator: Ross compliments Liz on her omelette folds and mentions that there is no colour on the egg.
Chef: You even tugged in the sides and got your seam at the bottom.
Narrator: Ross compliments Liz on her omelette folds and mentions that she has a seam at the bottom.
Chef: There is a very, very attractive nice looking egg and I would like to bet that it was still lovely and soft on the inside, so let’s just focus on the temperature, distributing the temperature all the way through the egg evenly and that moment when to stop allow your skin to form and than start your folds..
Narrator: Ross provides some concluding remarks on how to cook an omelette correctly.

The lesson is over. Let's talk to the pupil now to find out what they learned.

Narrator: What dish have you made today?
Pupil: I've made an omelette.
Narrator: How did the chef describe their vision for the dish?
Pupil: The chef said that they wanted an omelette that was light in color and had a bulbous like lemon. They also wanted the omelette to have a nice skin like a film on the outside, and when we cut into it a lovely, light, fluffy, cooked, but still soft, almost runny centre. The chef also said that the taste should be fresh and not have an eggy taste from being overcooked.
Narrator: Did you have any moments of doubt?
Pupil: I wasn't sure if I was cooking the omelette correctly because I was going faster than I usually do.
Narrator: What part of the recipe was the focus today?
Pupil: The focus today was on temperature control for the omelette.
Narrator: What was the key technique for that?
Pupil: The key technique was to stir the egg quick enough so it doesn't set, doesn't curdle, doesn't go hard and get that heat moving through the entire egg mix.
Narrator: Did the chef talk mostly about that?
Pupil: The chef talked mostly about that. They also gave some tips on how to fold the omelette correctly.
Narrator: How do you get control there?
Pupil: I think the key is to keep the heat moving through the entire egg mix and to stop cooking it when the skin starts to form.
Narrator: What's the reasoning, or science behind it? Pupil: I don't know the reasoning, or science, behind it.
Narrator: Is there a specific moment when you have to react and stop the process?
Pupil: I think the key is to stop cooking it when the skin starts to form.
Narrator: What happens when it goes wrong? Pupil: If you cook it for too long, it'll be hard and rubbery, or if you cook it for too short, it'll be raw.

The following is a transcript of a cooking lesson. The chef comments on the pupil's cooking itself and the narrator explains what the expert chef means.

Chef: The pupil just finished cooking, so let's see how did it go.
Narrator: The chef is about to start the lesson.
Chef: Yes, thank you for the second chili beans. This time, the aroma was very good.
Narrator: The chef thanks the pupil for the cooking and compliments their aroma.
Chef: The question is whether it's okay to mix the contents of the pan or not. It's a great idea to ask yourself this question.
Narrator: The chef brings the pupil's attention to mixing the contents of the pan.
Chef: This time, I'm going to continue to talk about the transfer of heat, but this time I'm going to talk about whether to mix it or not. I'm sure you'll agree that it's a good idea to have a little more time to think about what you're doing.
Narrator: The chef advises the pupil to take their time and think about what they're doing.
Chef: Do you think he doesn't like the fact that he can paddle? And why doesn't the mixture burn?
Narrator: The chef is curious about the pupil's thoughts on paddling and why the mixture doesn't burn.
Chef: In other words, the heat of frying and sharpening the pan is rising, and it is looking hot. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Narrator: The chef provides information on how to get in touch with the cooking school.
Chef: If you don't want it to be fragrant, or if you think it will burn beyond fragrant, you need to lower the temperature, so you need to let the outside air in and mix it in.
Narrator: The chef advises the pupil on how to lower the temperature if they want the food to be less fragrant or prevent it from burning.
Chef: If you think it's cold, you should know that when you boil it down, you remove water from it, and the temperature at which water evaporates is one hundred degrees. I'm sure you know that, but if you don't make it above that temperature, the water won't evaporate.
Narrator: The chef explains that water needs to reach the boiling point to evaporate properly.
Chef: If you find that the water doesn't come out easily, it means that the temperature is too low. If the temperature is too low, it means that the temperature is too low.
Narrator: The chef points out that if the water isn't coming out easily, the temperature is too low.
Chef: If the temperature is too high, it means that the temperature is too low. If the temperature is too low, it means that the temperature is too low.
Narrator: The chef reiterates that if the temperature is too high or low, the food won't cook properly.
Chef: So, for the third time, what do you want to do with this heat, what kind of effect do you want to get, for example, the heat to make the aroma, the heat to make the water go away, what kind of heat is this, how do you make this heat come out?
Narrator: The chef asks the pupil what they want to achieve with the heat.
Chef: I hope you can make even more delicious chili beans for the third time while thinking about it.
Narrator: The chef wishes the pupil luck and encourages them to think about the heat.

The lesson is over. Let's talk to the pupil now to find out what they learned.

Narrator: What dish have you made today?
Pupil: Today I made chili beans.
Narrator: How did the chef describe their ideal vision for the dish?
Pupil: The chef said that they wanted the dish to have a good aroma.
Narrator: What part of the recipe was the focus today?
Pupil: The focus was on how to mix the contents of the pan.
Narrator: What was the key technique for that?
Pupil: The key technique was to be aware of the transfer of heat.
Narrator: Did the chef talk mostly about that?
Pupil: The chef talked about that and also about how to control the temperature of the food.
Narrator: How do you get control of the process?
Pupil: By adjusting the heat, you can control the process.
Narrator: What's the reasoning, or science behind it?
Pupil: The reasoning is that if the heat is too high, the food will burn, and if the heat is too low, the food will not cook properly.
Narrator: When do you have to react?
Pupil: When the aromas are getting too intense, or burns.
