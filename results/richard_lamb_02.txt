The following is a transcript of a cooking lesson. The chef comments on the pupil's cooking itself and the narrator explains what the expert chef means.

Chef: The pupil just finished cooking, so let's see how did it go.
Narrator: The chef is about to start the lesson.
Chef: Hi Richard, Ross here, thank you very much for your first video.
Narrator: The chef is talking to the pupil.
Chef: I think you did a great job following the recipe that you had, the rich coloured one, so yeah very well done and I think you’re rightly happy with the outcome.
Narrator: The chef is praising the pupil's cooking.
Chef: You know your final comment in the second video.
Narrator: The chef is referring to a comment the pupil made in a previous cooking lesson.
Chef: You didn’t really have too many moments of doubt, but you did mention about the saltiness, so I think kind of look at what’s giving you that saltiness and can you tone it down or get rid of it.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: Remember with salt you can always add, but you can’t take away.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: That’s something you can tweak.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: I would like us to focus on the lamb, because that is the main part of a lamb navarin.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So on that my, sort of why I love about this dish is a classic addition, it’s a light, more summery stew rather than a dark rich stew.
Narrator: The chef is explaining the benefits of the pupil's cooking.
Chef: So that’s what I really like about it, it’s more delicate and it’s got a bit of finesse to it.
Narrator: The chef is praising the pupil's cooking.
Chef: The dish standard for taste - I’m looking for something that is rich, in appearance it should have some brightness on the vegetables and then not a beige kind of food.
Narrator: The chef is critiquing the pupil's cooking.
Chef: Texturally most important I would say is the tenderness lamb and the sauce should have a coating consistency, not watery and the smell should have just a lovely kind of lamb and nice kind of fragrant savoury flavour, eh, smell, sorry.
Narrator: The chef is critiquing the pupil's cooking.
Chef: One thing I really wanna focus on as a I said is the cooking of the lamb, ehm, for this one.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: To go through it two things that are really gonna give us a great lamb are the caramelising, creating the maillard reaction, which is when the proteins on the outside lamb caramelise and give us colour, which gives us the identity of meat, in this case lamb.
Narrator: The chef is explaining the benefits of the pupil's cooking.
Chef: And the second element is the braising element which then creates a nice tenderness to it.
Narrator: The chef is explaining the benefits of the pupil's cooking.
Chef: So, thinking about the first point that I made was the colour, so here you have mentioned kind of boiling away, I think in your video, that’s a key one there.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So we should be frying, doing whatever we need, maybe a frying pan or something like that to get a really hight temperature and to sear in the moisture within that lamb, so we’re using a brazing type of lamb from the leg or something, less tender.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So we braise with less tender, less premium secondary cuts we use.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So they’re less tender, so we need to work harder to make them deliverable.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So we need to get our caramelisation very high temp and get really nice colour.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: Seal in the juice and then, at this point we braise and that’s how we create our tenderness.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So if we cook too high, if we’re boiling, we’re gonna toughen that meat up and it’s gonna tense right up, so we need a nice just below simmering point to then, just to cook it low and slow.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: I’m sure you’ve heard the term before.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: So once we’ve got that initial heat in, bring it back to gentle simmer, turn the heat down and braise.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: We don’t wanna create something that is boiling away, tensing our meat.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: Yeah, those are the main focus, we wanna sear at a high temperature to create a lovely caramelised texture, eh crust, and then braising just below simmering point, to give us nice tender lamb.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: Ok, so let’s have a real focus on that lamb and just stop, when you get that lovely ehm consistency on the lamb.
Narrator: The chef is giving the pupil advice on how to improve their cooking.
Chef: Thank you, bye.
Narrator: The chef is thanking the pupil and ending the lesson.
Narrator: The lesson is over. Let's talk to the pupil now to find out what they learned.


Narrator: What dish have you made today?
Pupil: I've made a lamb navarin.
Narrator: How did the chef describe their vision for the dish?
Pupil: The chef wanted something that was rich, in appearance it should have some brightness on the vegetables and then not a beige kind of food.
Narrator: Did you have any moments of doubt?
Pupil: I was unsure about how salty the dish was.
Narrator: What focus did the lesson have today?
Pupil: The lesson focused on the cooking of the lamb.
Narrator: What was the key technique for that?
Pupil: The key technique was the caramelising, creating the maillard reaction, and the braising element.
Narrator: Did the chef talk mostly about that?
Pupil: The chef mainly talked about the caramelising and the braising element.
Narrator: How do you get control there?
Pupil: You get control by frying, doing whatever we need, maybe a frying pan or something like that to get a really hight temperature and to sear in the moisture within that lamb.
Narrator: What's the reasoning, or science behind it?
Pupil: The reasoning behind it is that you're creating a maillard reaction, which is when the proteins on the outside lamb caramelise and give us colour, which gives us the identity of meat, in this case lamb.
Narrator: When do you have to react?
Pupil: You have to react when you're searing in the moisture within that lamb.
Narrator: What happens when it goes wrong?
Pupil: When it goes wrong, the lamb can become tough and tense.
