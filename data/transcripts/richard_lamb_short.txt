Hi Richard, Ross here, thank you very much for your first video. I think you did a great job following the recipe that you had, the rich coloured one, so yeah very well done and I think you’re rightly happy with the outcome. You know your final comment in the second video. You didn’t really have too many moments of doubt, but you did mention about the saltiness, so I think kind of look at what’s giving you that saltiness and can you tone it down or get rid of it. Remember with salt you can always add, but you can’t take away. That’s something you can tweak. I would like us to focus on the lamb, because that is the main part of a lamb navarin. So on that my, sort of why I love about this dish is a classic addition, it’s a light, more summery stew rather than a dark rich stew. So that’s what I really like about it, it’s more delicate and it’s got a bit of finesse to it. The dish standard for taste - I’m looking for something that is rich, in appearance it should have some brightness on the vegetables and then not a beige kind of food. Texturally most important I would say is the tenderness lamb and the sauce should have a coating consistency, not watery and the smell should have just a lovely kind of lamb and nice kind of fragrant savoury flavour, eh, smell, sorry. One thing I really wanna focus on as a I said is the cooking of the lamb, ehm, for this one. To go through it two things that are really gonna give us a great lamb are the caramelising, creating the maillard reaction, which is when the proteins on the outside lamb caramelise and give us colour, which gives us the identity of meat, in this case lamb. And the second element is the braising element which then creates a nice tenderness to it. So, thinking about the first point that I made was the colour, so here you have mentioned kind of boiling away, I think in your video, that’s a key one there. So we should be frying, doing whatever we need, maybe a frying pan or something like that to get a really hight temperature and to sear in the moisture within that lamb, so we’re using a brazing type of lamb from the leg or something, less tender. Ok, so let’s have a real focus on that lamb and just stop, when you get that lovely ehm consistency on the lamb. Thank you, bye.
