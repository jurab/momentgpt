Hi, Flavia. It's Tijuana. I hope you're well and thank you so much for sending over your scrambled egg video. Looks really great and well done for really thinking about the equipment and utensils that you wanted to use as well that that was really good. Um, the texture of your final dish is the thing that it was kind of an area of improvement, for you didn't have that creamy, glossy texture that you wanted. So we will look at that for me. Scrambled eggs, Actually, my favourite type of eggs. Um, I love that they are creamy. I love that they taste rich and it almost quite indulgent, aren't they? And with such minimal ingredients, they taste amazing. So if we were thinking about the perfect scrambled egg, we want richness from the York. That's our taste. We want the appearance to be quite glossy and also very yellow. We don't want any grey or whiteness, Tuaregs. We want that silky and soft texture, and they need to be just set. Um, and if we were thinking about the smell of scrambled eggs, obviously they're going to smell of eggs. So for our coaching today, we're really going to focus on timing and heat control. That's going to give you that perfect texture. Before we get into that, I'd really love for you to try to use just a knob of butter instead of oil. Oil is going to heat up and fry the ingredient, and butter is going to be better, in fact, to use for this recipe. Um, okay, let's have a little look at your video here. So one thing to remember is eggs cook very easily with little heat. The longer you cook the eggs or heat the eggs, then the more water is going to come out and evaporate. And that's going to give you that Dr Fluffy consistency that we don't want in scrambled eggs. So a low heat is very important. The other thing that is going to get your right, um, texture is thinking about your timing. You'll notice that when your eggs come off the heat, they continue to cook, so getting the timing right is really important. When we look at your video here, um, that's just with to the next bit. Mm. So about this point, you can see there's a little bit of running this still in your eggs. That is the pone when you can be confident and take it off the heat because they're going to continue to cook. When we look at yours here, you're still cooking, and it's quite dry already. So think about your timing and trying to get them off the heat just a little bit sooner when there's still a little bit runny is honestly going to make all the difference. So have a go with that. This next time really think about your heat control. Low heat. Be patient and timing. Remember to take it off the heat just a little bit earlier than you actually think. And, yeah, I think once you've done that you'll be You'll be pretty good and I hope you enjoy it. Look forward to seeing your next video and I will speak to you soon. Bye.
