Hi Aki, thanks for your video. Your main goal is to achieve Paella Valenciana that you remember you had like with full of flavour and the rice nice and fluffy and so, let's see if we can get there. Ok. So, you say that the rice this time for the chicken this time goes much nicer and with a lot of moisture. The chicken looks great and nice color, nice color and looks good. I think you got it, the chicken and the beans and all this, you got it right. So, just keep doing this. With the tomato... if when you go to buy to the veg guy or the shop, local shop or whatever, when you see the uglies almost gone tomato this ones will have like full of flavour. So more ugly and almost gone, the better flavour it will have. You don't put in a salad, you're grating it, so doesn't matter if looks ugly. I mean, for the paella the biggest challenge is to cook the rice right. So good choice that you put chicken broth so all the paella will have a lot of flavour. If you add water you have to do the stock in the pan a la minute, it's a good choice to have it done before. Ok. The rice. The biggest problem is the rice. The rice you say that you're using arborio rice. This type of rice is used normally for rice pudding and risotto, because has a lot of a starch and helps for the technique called liaison to thicken a sauce in this case using the starch of the rice. If you can't find bomba rice I think you have to think to take in all the starch out from the rice so, just think how you can take all the starch before you put in the pan. Each type of rice has different measures for the liquid, some of them takes one part of rice, one part of liquid. Some of them one part of rice, two parts of liquid. Some of theme even three parts of, three and a half parts of liquid so just think how you can, you can find out which type of rice you are using and how much water that, how much water you have to put inside. The pan, the pan you are using, the pan you are using, an electric pan that you are using just keep bear mind that it's quite thick, so the temperature changes will take longer because it will keep longer the heat. To do the paellas normally the pans are very thin metal ones so when you put the heat high it goes quick and when you put the heat down the temperature will come, will go down quicker than if the pan is thick that will keep the heat for longer. And, for the socarrat when you put at the end the heat there's a thing that the paella has to have still a little bit of moisture or a little bit of stock inside, so finished absorbing all the stock and is when will start like toasting the rice from the bottom. In Valencia and Alicante normally the people always rest the paella so normally they put a little bit of tinfoil inside and you rest a little bit so all the grains can absorb all the flavours that are in the pan so think about resting it a little bit and just cover it with something.
