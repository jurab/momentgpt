Yes, thank you for the second chili beans. This time, the aroma was very good. The question is whether it's okay to mix the contents of the pan or not. It's a great idea to ask yourself this question. This time, I'm going to continue to talk about the transfer of heat, but this time I'm going to talk about whether to mix it or not. I'm sure you'll agree that it's a good idea to have a little more time to think about what you're doing. Do you think he doesn't like the fact that he can paddle? And why doesn't the mixture burn? In other words, the heat of frying and sharpening the pan is rising, and it is looking hot. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you don't want it to be fragrant, or if you think it will burn beyond fragrant, you need to lower the temperature, so you need to let the outside air in and mix it in. If you think it's cold, you should know that when you boil it down, you remove water from it, and the temperature at which water evaporates is one hundred degrees. I'm sure you know that, but if you don't make it above that temperature, the water won't evaporate. If you find that the water doesn't come out easily, it means that the temperature is too low. If the temperature is too low, it means that the temperature is too low. If the temperature is too high, it means that the temperature is too low. If the temperature is too low, it means that the temperature is too low. So, for the third time, what do you want to do with this heat, what kind of effect do you want to get, for example, the heat to make the aroma, the heat to make the water go away, what kind of heat is this, how do you make this heat come out? I hope you can make even more delicious chili beans for the third time while thinking about it.
