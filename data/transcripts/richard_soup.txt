Hi, Richard. Thanks very much for your video. Um, second cook of French onion soup. And, yeah, it looks like the corker. So we're done. Um, taste you giving yourself a four out of five, I think you hold him back there. I think, um, yeah, I think you're happy. Happier than you were on the first one. For sure. Delicious combination of sweetness from the onion and the savouriness from the stock needed a bit pepper at the end. That's great. It's nice that you're getting that confidence now to be able to tweet to your taste. Appearance was toast was just right. Use Briere added. A sprinkler passed the written lovely Um, smell four or five sweet smell of onion. That's great. Interesting to see if your stock you had a good stock, he said. Michael Properties all fresh, um, stopped from the supermarket, being just to see whether that made an impact as well. Texture, he said. Onions sliced evenly melted cheese under we get good ratio of onion to stop. Fantastic as brilliant. There's really good to see that you're really taking on the feedback. Um, and I'm glad that you sent the picture because I think it gives a real give me an even better kind of, um, impression of the final product. Then on the moment camera, it looked a little bit kind of light and everybody looking at that picture of the photo until that was a really nice colour and would have been nice and rich. So well, so on the next part of the video, I'm going to go into the usual kind of free step structure. And first of all, just remind us a while. Our goals were aiming for my my standard for the dish. And secondly, I'll give you a bit of an evaluation. Bit of a summary of wife, I thought from your your cook and then thirdly, um, just focus on the coaching had to get you from where you are now to that kind of that peak kind of wine after for the dish standard. So first off, um, is to just talk about the those dish standards. So the French onion soup is a real classic French dish, very hearty kind of workers dish, humble plate of food. But you know, with the right balance of every think, it can be a real kind of greater than the means of its parts. So the sum of its parts apology. So, you know, um, it should have a richness from the stock sweetness, kind of countering that from the onions and then a nice bit of kind of added richness and texture from a lovely, cheesy Cretan. But so it's seemingly very simple. But all those kind of factors have to be just right to really kind of elevate and give a true French onions to, um yet as many of those things that they're not quite right. You end up with a pleasant bowl of food or everybody won't be like kind of nourishing, real kind of comfort, satisfying bowl of food. So really interesting to get that kind of right mix of texture sweet and savoury nous as well. Um, for my second part of video, for my evaluation of what I saw was really impressive. Richard, you're you're kind of discipline for keeping young is moving. You slice the nice and thin. So not even Finn to it. Just equally, you know, you couldn't even even amount of time. They were sliced relief evenly. They cooked at the right speed, and I could see there was no hot patches. You didn't get any burned patches in the pan. They all completely caramelised at the same speed. And that's a real, you know, sort of credit to the patients. You must have shown that a lot of love and care and stood over for a long time. And it's completely worth it because I think you've produced a cracking French onion soup. As I said in the video, I thought maybe your onions were a little bit light, and maybe you're creating a little bit like but actually in that picture that you sent me quite the opposite. You know, they looked, you know, just really nice. I can tell that that would have soaked up a nice bit of stock and still had a bit of Texas. You would have been able to feel it, and I like the fact that you've cook yourself a few extras because he doesn't want a bit of extra cheese on toast on the side. But I tell you, if you could have, like squeezed another one in in your bowl or whatever, just so you get kind of more of that, um, sort of satisfactory kind of crude Romanesque crunch would have been, would have been great. But on the whole, we should. Fantastic, Really good. Really, really good. So for the video, I just want to kind of just reminded just sort of more kind of going over these things and where we could potentially even home it in your home in a little bit further. Depending. Obviously, I can't. I can't taste it. But you know you'll have a memory in your head and just kind of give you that. An idea about what? These different steps. How they can control the outcome, basically, so I'll start with the onions. So is this the last time you use red onion and why it's on you? So interestingly, they would cook at different times so you wouldn't get the same amount of coloration. For example, um, from a white onion, a red onion because they're just two different kind of things. Um, it would be enough to ruin by any means, but it just would make a difference. So here you've got the same start of onion. You sliced it the same thickness. You're cooking it evenly, so already you're giving yourself a great starting point. You're not trying to counter two different varieties with two different levels of sweetness or wherever it may be. Um, you know, as we said, that your stock if you've got a nice, rich, deep stock, then you want a bit of obviously sweetness from the onion. To counter that, and to make it more, more, it's basically and balanced. Whereas with this, um, if you found when you were eating it. Actually, for the amount of onion that was in the soup, it became a little bit sweet. Then you've got two things you can even not add that extra sugar in this process, or you can caramelise a little bit less. Um, because basically, you go through to, um, stages. You kind of start off with a soft kind of mild onion and then, as you go to like gold, and that's when it's at its most sweet. But then, if you go even further, it's slightly darker. That is when you will start to go savoury again and you get up kind of more kind of. It's not bitter, but it's leaning towards bitter. And then if you carried on, colouring it to a very dark brown. That's when you would have bitter. So you've got this kind of mild onion. Then you go into sweetness at this point. Now we've got a nice sweetness. What, at the point where you stopped it, which I thought was perfect, is where you would have just got to point where you're going back to sort of savouriness and you're gonna start leaning towards bitter again. Um, or very deep richness. And you stopped at exactly the right moment, so that would have been quite sweet on the onion. So if you feel inside, you know, actually, it was a little bit too sweet, or I might try it a little bit more savoury next time. You could just take your onions a little bit further, just going a little bit darker. But to be honest, I think you completely know that. But just to give you an idea about you know, if you went softer, um, you would just have a mild kind of oniony thing. You wouldn't really have much of a sweetness or bitterness or kind of complexity and flavour that maybe complexity is a good word to use kind of the darker it goes more complex. It gets so to speak. Um, so, yeah, just something to think about. But you can always go too far, and it would be very bitter. And along with the savoury stock will get a bit to bit to kind of yet another tip just at the beginning is when you are going soft on your getting your onions. And originally, is that yeah, here, if you if you You know. So I didn't notice that you and your video, but yeah, if you put a lid on that the first we'll just trap some of that steam, start to soften it. Um, and then when you see it going nice and soft and just lose the lid. But it looks like so he came back over the video. You were doing that anyway. So perfect. Really good. Um and then, yeah, the next part of it I wanted to focus on is the Cretan. So here. Nice beget. Um and yeah, you got the right cheese this time. Hopefully, you saw that improvement. You toasted your crew to first to get a nice kind of firm. This around the edge, but not too dark. So when you caramelise it, it's gonna burn. But this was a really nice, um, really nice touch. And quite so another option is obviously it depends on the you know what you have available to you. But quite often the French would use a a larger piece of bread or sort of low size, like a panda compound or something like that, where it's actually kind of a cut through cuts, so to be, is more like the size of your bowl or the surface area of your bowl. So rather than having sort of lots of little ones, um, you kind of have one big one, which basically acting like a lid of the soup, and that would kind of then soak up the crews on soap. That's an option. I'm not telling you to go and do that, but if if you wanted to try something different, we could do it. But it's more important that you kind of concentrate on that getting nice level of kind of cook on your on your big get. You know when you did that first toast before you added the cheese, because if it's too soft, it would just dissolve as soon as it hits the hot soak the hot stock, Um, and just kind of dissolve into the super. It would be very nice. You won't know that you had bread in there, you know, just get lost within it. Um, but, you know, you want to have a nice it wants to be firm enough that it can take a bit of that resilience from the stock. Obviously, on the other hand, we don't want it to be rock hard and be not very pleasant to eat. So well done. It's more just a bit of maybe fine tune into your taste to speak conscious on the amount of colour that we get on our onions. And secondly, just concentrating on that crew tournament and making sure your crew and still has a bit of texture to give the dish. And, yeah, and most of all, just very well done, Richard. And, you know, it was a very confident cook. I think so. Well done.
