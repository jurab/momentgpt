Hi Richard ross here, thank you very much for your first video. I think you did a great job following the recipe that you had, the Richard Corrigan one. so you are very well done and I think you're rightly happy with the outcome. You know, looking at your um, you know, your, your final comment in the second video to you, you didn't really have too many moments of doubt, but you did mention about the saltiness. So I think kind of look at what's giving you that saltiness and can you tone it down or you can get rid of it? Remember with salt we can always add but we can't take away. So something you can, you can tweak. I would like us to more have focused on the lamb because that is the main part of a lamb, no veran. Um so on that my, what I love about this dish is a classic steeped in tradition. It's a, a light, more summery stewed than a normal classic kind of dark meat stew. So that's why I really like about it. It's a lot more delicate and it's got a bit of finesse to it. Um the, this standard for taste, I'm looking for something that is rich um in appearance, it should have some brightness from the vegetables in there, not a beige, greater food texturally and most importantly, I would say is the tenderness of the lamb and the sauce should have a coating consistency, not, not watery and the smell should just have a lovely kind of lamb and nice kind of fragrant savory flavor smell. Sorry, the one thing I really want to focus on as I said is the cooking of the lamb for this one. No, to go through it. The two things that are going to really give us a great lamb is the caramelizing, creating the mala reaction, which is a when the proteins on the outside of the lamb caramelize and give us a color, which gives us the identity of meat and in this case lamb and the second part is the braising element, which then creates a nice tenderness to it. So thinking about the first point that I made was the color. So here you have mentioned kind of boiling away, I think in your video and that's the key one there. So we should be frying, doing whatever we need, maybe a frying pan, something like that to get really high temperature and to seal in the moisture within that lamb. So we're using a braising type of lambs and maybe from the leg or something less tender. So we braised with less tender, less premium secondary cuts we use. So they're not as tender. So we need to work harder to make them deliverable. So we need to get our caramelization very high temp and get a nice colo our ceiling that juice and then at this point we braise and that is when we create our tenderness. So if we cook too high, if we're boiling, we're going to toughen that meet up, it's going to tense right up. So we need a nice just below simmering point. So then just to cook it low and slow. I'm sure you've heard the term before. So once we've got that initial heating, bring it back to a gentle simmer, turn the heat down and braise. We don't want to create something that is boiling away, tensing our meat. Um So yet those are the main focus. We want to seal at a high temperature to create a lovely caramelized texture crust and then braising just below simmering point to give us a nice tender lamb. Okay so let's have a real focus on that lamb and just stop when you get that lovely um consistency on the lam. Thank you. Bye.
